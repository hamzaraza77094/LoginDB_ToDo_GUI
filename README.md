# LoginDB_ToDo_GUI
This is a GUI that creates a SQLite3 Database login page in order to reach a To-Do List GUI that allows you to save and open Lists.

In order to use the App
1. You must uncomment lines 12-15 in order to create the database
2. When the login page opens, first write a username and password and click register in order to register those in the database
3. Once that is done, you can use that same login user and password and click submit in order to load the to-do list
4. Once in to-do app you can add, select, delete, and open existing to-do files
5. Once done you can save the file into a folder of your choice
6. You can select log out to see the login page again and repeat the process again or exit out and all other windows according to the GUI will close
7. There is a special way to see whos registered in the database by using the admin user and password by writing
  - user: admin
  - password: admin123
 This will show all the people registered in the database once you exit out of the notes GUI
